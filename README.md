# OC_3DPrintModels
A Repository for Models for the OpenComputer 3D Printer
<br>
# How to use these models:
1. Go to the Print3D path and find a Model you want
2. Open the page with the code
3. Either copy the code or the raw link
4. If you have the code, paste it in a file on your OpenComputer, else use "wget [link]" and download the file
5. Use print3d "[model]" to print the model. Make sure you have a 3D Printer
<br>To get print3d you need oppm to install it (oppm install print3d)
<br>
